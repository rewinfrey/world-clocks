### About

This is a simple HTML / CSS / JavaScript project to demonstrate the use of a single `setInterval` function to calculate and apply the UTC offsets for various world cities.

Inteded for education and learning purposes only.  The CSS is based on an [analog clock from dev.to](https://dev.to/code_mystery/simple-analog-clock-using-html-css-javascript-2c6a).
